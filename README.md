# Daily React Kitchen Sink Demo

This project console logs every event listener for Daily React. This is a great
way to debug exactly what events are fired when trying to reproduce an issue.

## ðŸŽ£ Daily Recording Webhooks Demo

This project now includes a **Daily Recording Webhooks Demo** that demonstrates how to handle Daily's recording webhooks. When you run the development server, it automatically starts:

- **React App** on http://localhost:3000 (Daily video call interface)
- **Webhook Server** on http://localhost:4000 (Handles recording webhooks)

### Webhook Endpoints

- `POST /webhooks/recording-ready` - Handles `recording.ready-to-download` events
- `POST /webhooks/recording-error` - Handles `recording.error` events  
- `POST /webhooks/test` - General webhook verification endpoint
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

### Quick Start

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the demo: `npm run dev` 
3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
4. Join a Daily room and start a recording to see webhook events logged in the console

For detailed webhook setup instructions, see [WEBHOOK_DEMO.md](./WEBHOOK_DEMO.md)

## Available Scripts
